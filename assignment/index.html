    <h4>Hello, and welcome to the page for my first assignment!  Thanks for reviewing my content!</h4>
    <h4>Here's some fun facts about me:</h4>

  <div class="facts">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Fun Fact #1</b>: My background is actually in IT, as I currently hold my Associates in Computer Science.  Unfortunately, I was never able to break into the field after graduation -- that'll change with Prime!</li><br />
      <li><b>Fun Fact #2</b>: I've been doing Muay Thai (aka Thai Kickboxing) for about ten years, and have even fought in the ring!  It's an excellent way to keep in shape and stay humble.</li><br />
      <li><b>Fun Fact #3</b>: My other passion is PC Gaming.  I built and use my own rig, which was a great experience, and am now building another for my partner.  Competitive first-person shooters, such as Overwatch or Call of Duty, currently hold my gaming interest.</li>
